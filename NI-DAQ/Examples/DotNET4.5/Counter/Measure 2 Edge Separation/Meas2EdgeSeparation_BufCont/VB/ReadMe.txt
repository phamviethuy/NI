Description:             This example demonstrates how to perform a continuous
                         number of two edge separation measurements 
                         on a counter input channel.  The first edge, second edge,
                         minimum value, maximum value, and samples to 
                         read are all configurable. This example shows how to
                         perform a two edge separation measurement on the 
                         counter's default input terminals (refer to the I/O
                         Connections Overview below for more information), 
                         but could easily be expanded to measure two edge
                         separation on any PFI, RTSI, or internal signal.Refer 
                         to your device documentation to see if your device
                         supports two edge separation measurements.
