Description:             This example demonstrates how to measure angular
                         position using a quadrature encoder on a counter input
                         channel.  The decoding type, pulses per revolution,
                         z-index enable, z-index phase, z-index value, and sample
                         clock source are all configurable. Position is measured
                         on the counter's default A, B, and Z input terminals
                         (see I/O Connections Overview below for more
                         information).Note: For buffered position measurement, an
                         external sample clock is necessary to signal when a
                         sample should be inserted into the buffer.  This is set
                         by the sample clock source.
