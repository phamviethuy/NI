Description:             This example demonstrates how to generate a single
                         digital pulse from a counter output channel.  The
                         initial delay, high time, low time, and idle state are
                         all software configurable. This example shows how to
                         configure the pulse in terms of time, but can easily be
                         modified to generate a pulse in terms of frequency and
                         duty cycle or ticks.
