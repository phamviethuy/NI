Description:             This example demonstrates how to generate a continuous
                         buffered sample clocked digital pulse train from a
                         Counter Output Channel. The Frequency, Duty Cycle, and
                         Idle State are all configurable. The default data
                         generated is a pulse train with a fixed frequency but a
                         duty cycle that varies based on the Duty Cycle Max/Min
                         and the signal type. The duty cycle will update with
                         each sample clock edge.
