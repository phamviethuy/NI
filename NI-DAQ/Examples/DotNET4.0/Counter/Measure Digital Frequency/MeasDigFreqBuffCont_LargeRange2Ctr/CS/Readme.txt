Description:             This example demonstrates how to measure buffered
                         frequency using two counters on a counter 
                         input channel. The divisor, maximum and minimum frequency
                         values, and the edge parameter are configurable.This 
                         example shows how to measure frequency on the counter's
                         default input terminal (see I/O Connections Overview 
                         below for more information), but could easily be expanded
                         to measure frequency on any PFI, RTSI, or internal 
                         signal. Additionally, this example could be extended to
                         measure frequency with other measurement methods 
                         for different frequency and quantization error
                         requirements.
