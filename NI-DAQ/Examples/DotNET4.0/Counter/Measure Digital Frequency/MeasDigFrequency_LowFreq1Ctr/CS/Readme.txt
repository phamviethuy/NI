Description:             This example demonstrates how to measure a frequency
                         using one counter on a counter input channel.  The
                         starting edge, minimum value and maximum value are all
                         configurable. This example shows how to measure
                         frequency on the counter's default input terminal (see
                         I/O Connections Overview below for more information),
                         but could easily be expanded to measure frequency on any
                         PFI, RTSI, or internal signal.  Additionally, this
                         example could be extended to measure frequency with two
                         counters for different frequency and quantization error
                         requirements.
