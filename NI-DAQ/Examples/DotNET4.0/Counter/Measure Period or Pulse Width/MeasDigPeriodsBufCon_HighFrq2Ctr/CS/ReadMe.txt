Description:             This example demonstrates how to measure periods using
                         two counters on a counter input channel.  The
                         measurement time, sample mode, and samples per read are
                         configurable.This example shows how to measure period on
                         the counters default input terminal, (see I/O
                         Connections Overview below for more information), , but
                         could easily be expanded to measure periods on any PFI,
                         RTSI, or internal signal.  Additionally, this example
                         could be extended to measure period with other
                         measurement methods for different frequency and
                         quantization error requirements.
