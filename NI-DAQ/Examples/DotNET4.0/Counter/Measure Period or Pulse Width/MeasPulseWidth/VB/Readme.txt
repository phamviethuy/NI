Description:             This example demonstrates how to measure pulse width on
                         a counter input channel. The edge, minimum value and
                         maximum value are all configurable.This example shows
                         how to measure pulse width on the counter's default
                         input terminal (see I/O Connections Overview below for
                         more information), but could easily be expanded to
                         measure pulse width on any PFI, RTSI, or internal
                         signal.
