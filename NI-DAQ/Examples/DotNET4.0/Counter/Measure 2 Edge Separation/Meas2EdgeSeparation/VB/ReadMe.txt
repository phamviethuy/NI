Description:             This example demonstrates how to measure two edge
                         separation on a counter input channel. The first edge,
                         second edge, minimum value, and maximum value are all
                         configurable. This example measures two edge separation
                         on the counter's default input terminals (see I/O
                         Connections Overview below for more information), but
                         could easily be expanded to measure two edge separation
                         on any PFI, RTSI, or internal signal. Refer to your
                         device documentation to see if your device supports two
                         edge separation measurements.
