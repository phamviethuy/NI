Description:             This example demonstrates how to generate a continuous
                         digital pulse train from a counter output channel using
                         a digital start trigger. The frequency, duty cycle, and
                         idle state are all configurable.This example shows how
                         to configure the pulse in terms of frequency and duty
                         cycle, but it can easily be modified to generate a pulse
                         in terms of time or ticks.
