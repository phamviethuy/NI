Description:             This example demonstrates how to generate a continuous
                         digital pulse train from a counter output channel and
                         controlled by an external digital pause trigger.  The
                         frequency, duty cycle, and idle state are all
                         configurable.This example shows how to configure the
                         pulse in terms of frequency and duty cycle, but can
                         easily be modified to generate a pulse in terms of time
                         or ticks.
