Example Title:           Simple Asynchronous Read/Write

Category:                NI-VISA

Description:             This example demonstrates how to use the NI-VISA .NET Library to
                         perform simple asynchronous operations.  With asynchronous
                         operations, you first call a method to start the operation. You then
                         call a second method to complete the operation.  The first method
                         returns a handle that you can use to check the progress of the operation.

Language:                Visual C#
