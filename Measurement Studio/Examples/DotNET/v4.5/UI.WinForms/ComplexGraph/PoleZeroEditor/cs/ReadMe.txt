Description:             This example demonstrates using the 2D ComplexGraph in creating a pole-zero editor.
			 The Pole-Zero Editor assists users to create linear systems using a pole-zero plot. 
			 Using the tool, one can interactively plot poles and zeroes in the complex plane. The 
			 filter characteristics of the system is updated as the user manipulates the poles and 
			 the zeroes. Operations can be performed on individual poles/zeroes or a group of them. 
			 The 'Select' menu item or the context menu has options to determine how poles and zeroes 
			 can be selected. The poles and the zeroes can be moved, added or deleted by using the 
			 context menu, main menu items or via the list entries.
