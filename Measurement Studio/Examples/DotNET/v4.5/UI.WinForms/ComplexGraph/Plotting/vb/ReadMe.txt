Description:             This example demonstrates plotting in the 2D ComplexGraph. The numeric edit 
			 controls in Real Data group box control the generation of the real part of the complex
			 numbers.  The numeric edit control in the Imaginary Data group box control the generation
			 of the imaginary part of the complext numbers.  When ever one of these changes, and initial
			 100 points of data are plotted to the graph using PlotComplex.  When the timer fires and 
			 additional complext number is added to the graph using PlotComplexAppend.
