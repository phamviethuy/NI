Category:                User Interface - Numeric Pointer
                         
Description:             This example demonstrates interaction with the numeric pointer controls
                        (gauge, knob, meter, slide, tank, and thermometer). The controls support 
                        interaction using the mouse, mouse-wheel and the keyboard. The left and right 
                        arrow buttons in the Settings group box move the pointer to the next and 
                        previous values of the control. The Value numeric edit control displays the 
                        value of the control that has focus. Click on the caption of the control to 
                        give the control focus. When the Coercion Mode is set to None, the Coercion 
                        Interval value is used for keyboard interaction.
