Description:		This example demonstrates real world uses for the numeric pointer controls.
			The throttle control can be increased or decreased, which effects the
			airspeed, altitude, RPMs, and fuel consumption.  The engine can be stopped
			by switching the master switch to off.  To restart the engine, switch
			the master switch to on and flip the start engine switch.
