Description:             This example demonstrates creating a custom coercion mode 
                         for the .NET Gauge control. The gauge has 3 regions                          
                         defined on it, where each region has a different coercion                          
                         behavior. The gauge is bound to a numeric edit control.                          
                         This allows changing the value of the gauge control by                          
                         using the mouse or by changing the value on the numeric                          
                         edit control. Since the numeric edit control is bound to                          
                         the gauge control with the custom coercion, the numeric                          
                         edit control also inherits the coercion behavior of the                          
                         gauge control. Set the Coercion Interval and the Coercion                          
                         Interval Base for the gauge control by setting the                          
                         appropriate numeric edit control.
