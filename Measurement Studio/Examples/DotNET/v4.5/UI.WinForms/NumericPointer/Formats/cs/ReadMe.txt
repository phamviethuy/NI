Description:    This example demonstrates different formatting options 
        for the numeric pointer controls such as different axis formats, horizontal 
        and vertical styles for the linear numeric pointers, fill modes and fill styles 
        for linear numeric pointers, inverted scales, and custom divisions. the voltage 
        and resistance controls can be increase or decrease, which changes the power according
        to the formula (power = (voltage * voltage) / resistance). You can use the power
        limit control to set the maximum power that can be generated.
