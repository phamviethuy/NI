Description:                 This example demonstrates how you can use cursors in the Intensity Graph. The "Cursor Locked/Cursor Free" switch controls whether the cursor snaps to the plot or whether the cursor can be freely dragged anywhere in the plot area.  The "Set Position" button sets the cursor to the data positions that are specified in the "X Position" and "Y Position" numeric controls. The "X Index" and "Y Index" NumericEdit controls set the cursor index.  The "Back" and "Next" buttons navigate to the previous and next indices in X or Y direction on the plot.
