Description:                   This example demonstrates how to use color on the Intensity Graph to display 3D data on a 2D plot area. In this example, input data size can be changed using the numeric edit controls in the "Input Data Size" group box. Use the checkbox to enable or disable pixel interpolation. Click on the "Edit Color Map" button to launch the Color Map editor, which you can use to modify values and colors. Use the other numeric edit controls in the "Plot And Color Map Settings" group box to vary the plot parameters.
