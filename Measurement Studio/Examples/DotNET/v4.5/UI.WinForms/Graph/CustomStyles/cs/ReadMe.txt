Description:             This example demonstrates the extensibility features of the 2D Graph. The
                         radio buttons in each group box can be used to set the specified feature to  
                         its default value or a custom value. The Disabled checkbox disables the
                         feature. The custom line style shades the plot line red to blue from top
                         to bottom. The custom point style demonstrates the use of value dependent
                         point styles by overriding the PointStyle.IsValueDependent property.
                         Selecting the Custom option in the Point Size group box increases the
                         width and height of the point by 2. The custom border draws a flat,
                         double-edged border around the 2D Graph.
