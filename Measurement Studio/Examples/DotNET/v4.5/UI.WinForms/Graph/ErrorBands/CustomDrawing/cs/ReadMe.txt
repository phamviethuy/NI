Description:             This example demonstrates custom drawing of error bands in the 2D Graph.

                         The radio buttons select different custom drawing modes defined in the 
                         example.  Normal performs no custom drawing (drawing is performed by the 
                         plot); Region draws a filled region defined by the high and low error 
                         points; Box and Whisker mimcs the style of "Box and Whisker" or "Boxplot" 
                         statistical plots by drawing boxes centered on the plot data points.
