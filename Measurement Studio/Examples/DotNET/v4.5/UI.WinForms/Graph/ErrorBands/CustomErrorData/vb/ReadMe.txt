Description:             This example demonstrates the use of custom error data modes in the 2D Graph.

                         The radio buttons select different error data modes for the plot.  None does 
                         not generate any error data; the custom Arbitrary mode uses an arbitrary array 
                         of error offsets specified by the user when data is plotted; the custom 
                         Combination mode returns either constant or percent offsets, based on whether 
                         the point values are above a certain threshold.

                         The edit controls change different properties on the custom error data modes.  
                         The Limit control sets the maximum value used for generating the error data 
                         sent to the for the Arbitrary mode.  The Constant and Percent controls set 
                         the constant and percent offsets used by the Combination mode, and the 
                         Threshold control sets the point at which the Combination mode changes from 
                         constant to percent.
