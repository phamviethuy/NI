Description:             
				This example demonstrates the new AutoScaleVisibleLoose axis scaling 
			mode for the 2D Graph.
			 
				A noisy signal is plotted in both graphs.  The graph on the left uses 
			the new AutoScaleVisibleLose mode, which scales to fit the data within 
			range of the other axis.  The graph on the right uses the existing 
			AutoScaleLoose mode, which scales to fit the entire plot history.  There 
			is also a similar new AutoScaleVisibleExact mode to correspond with the 
			old AutoScaleExact mode.
			 
				Use the "Pause" checkbox and "Clear" button to control the plotting of 
			data.  When the graphs are paused, you can pan over the plot history 
			interactively.
			 
				Refer to the AxisMode enumeration help for more information on both 
			of the new AutoScaleVisible axis modes.
