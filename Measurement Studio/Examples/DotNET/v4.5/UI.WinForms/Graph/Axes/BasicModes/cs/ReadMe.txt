Description:             This example demonstrates axis scaling in the 2D Graph. The Plot Data 					 
			 button plots a set of data to the graph. The radio buttons in 				 
			 each group box control the scaling on the specified axis. Set 		   		 
			 the radio button to Autoscale to automatically scale the respective axis 				 
			 based on the data plotted to the axis. Set the radio button to Manual to 				 
			 manually scale the axis. The numeric up-down controls can be used to set 				 
			 the minimum and maximum values of the axis being scaled. The numeric 					 
			 up-down controls only have an effect when the Manual radio button is checked.
