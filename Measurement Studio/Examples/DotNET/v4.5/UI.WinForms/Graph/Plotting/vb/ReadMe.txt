Description:             This example demonstrates the use of a 2-dimensional data array to plot 
                         multiple sets of data to the 2D Graph. The slider labeled Number of Plots 
                         controls the number of plots on the graph. The Points Per Plot 
                         slider increases or decreases the number of points plotted on each plot. 
                         The switch provides the ability to toggle between plots stacked on top of 
                         each other versus plots overlaying each other.
