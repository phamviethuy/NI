Description:             This example demonstrates the ability to extend the graph.  The class PointAnnotationGraph derives from WaveformGraph and overrides OnAfterDrawPlot to show the coordinates of plot points.  Change the switch to Generate Values.  After some values have been generated, set the switch to stop, and hover the mouse over a plot point.  Notice that the plot point is displayed in the plot area of the graph.
