Category:                User Interface - 2D Graph
                         
Description:             This example demonstrates the ease of printing the 2D Graph. The radio 
                         buttons can be used to select between individual plots, the entire 2D 
                         Graph control, and plots stacked in their own plot area sharing a 
                         common x axis. The Print Preview button allows you to preview the 
                         selection before printing. The Print button prints the selection to the 
                         default printer.
