Description:             This example demonstrates runtime configuration of Measurement Studio
                         Windows Forms controls. The example uses a 2D graph for illustration.
                         The controls can be configured at runtime through the use of context
                         menus. Right-click on the plot point to configure the properties of
                         the plot. Right-click on the axis, cursor, and annotation to configure
                         their properties at runtime. The plot and cursor properties can also
                         changed by right-clicking on plot and cursor legend.
