Description:             This example demonstrates the ability to extend and customize the 2D graph through pre-plot and post-plot drawing events. After some values have been generated, select a radio button to see the following three customizations: highlighting of the minimum and maximum value in the plot, highlighting the increasing and decreasing line segments of the plot, and highlighting the plot area background regions via custom pre-plot drawing.
