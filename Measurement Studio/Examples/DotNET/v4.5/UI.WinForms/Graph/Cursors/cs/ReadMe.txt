Description:            This example demonstrates cursors in the 2D graph.
             The Cursor Locked/Cursor Free switch controls whether the cursor
             snaps to the plot or whether the cursor can be freely dragged
             anywhere in the plot area.  The Set Position button will
             explicitly set the cursor to the data positions that are
             specified in the X Position/Y Position numeric numeric controls.
             The Index numeric control will set the cursor to the specified
             index in the plot.  The Back and Next buttons will navigate to
             the back and next indices in the plot respectively.
