Description:             This example demonstrates the use of the ScatterGraph which plots x and y data 			values allowing you to plot non-monotonically increasing data. In this example, you 			are able to plot circular, octagonal, polar or spiral shapes. You can also visualize 			the X data and the Y data on their respective plots.
