Category:                User Interface - Control Array
                         
Description:             This example demonstrates the core features of array controls such
			 as the Led array, Switch array, and NumericEdit array. The features
			 include the ability to set the length of the array to a fixed size
			 as well as dynamically size the array based on the number of data
			 values. The array controls can be laid out in horizontal and
			 vertical orientation and the properties of each control in the
			 array can be independently modified using the indexer of the
			 control.
