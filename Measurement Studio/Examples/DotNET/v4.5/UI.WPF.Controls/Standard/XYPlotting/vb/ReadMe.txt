Description:             This example demonstrates the use of the WPF Graph by plotting x and y data
                         values allowing you to plot non-monotonically increasing data. In this example, you
						 are able to plot circular, octagonal, polar or spiral shapes. You can also visualize
						 the X data and the Y data on their respective plots.
