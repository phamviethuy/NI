Description:             This example demonstrates how to easily write DAQmx-acquired data to files and how to read the files back into an application and display the data on a graph. Use the Configure menu to configure either a real DAQmx voltage acquisition or a simulated acquisition. Use the Acquire menu to acquire DAQmx data or to generate simulated data. Use the File>>Save All menu item to save the entire data set. Move the cursors and use the File>>Save Selection menu item to save the data between the cursors. Use the File>>Open menu item to open a file that you previously saved and plot the data it contains on the graph.
