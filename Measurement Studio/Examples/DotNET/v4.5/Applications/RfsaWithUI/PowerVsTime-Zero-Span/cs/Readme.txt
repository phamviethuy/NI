Description:             Use this example to learn how to acquire I/Q data using the RF vector
			 signal analyzer. The example shows how to configure NI-RFSA for continuous
			 I/Q acquisition, how to set the carrier frequency and the I/Q rate, and how
			 to fetch I/Q data. The dBm calculation is applied to I/Q magnitude to produce
			 signal power and display it on the graph.
