Description:             This example demonstrates streaming waveform data to a TDMS file. 
			             It demonstrates writing waveforms with regular, irregular and no timing information. 
			             This example also shows the setting up of TDMS file for different waveform layouts 
			             and appending waveforms to the TDMS file. In this example we generate the data programatically,
			             this example can be easily modified to acquire data from a hardware library instead.
