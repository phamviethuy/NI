Category:                TDMS
                         
Description:             This example demonstrates how to use the NationalInstruments.Tdms class library
                         to view the data within a file created using the TDMS data model.  It includes
                         a user control which displays the file hierarchy, properties, and data in a user
                         interface.  You can include the TdmsReaderUserControl in your applications to
                         easily display the structure and data of a TDMS file in a user interface.
                         
                         A sample TDMS file is included in the example directory.  To open this file 
                         with the TDMS Reader, run the example and browse to the file 'TdmsSampleData.tdms'.  
                         This file has sample data which includes analog and digital waveforms and 
                         other supported data types.
                         
                         If you open the main form in the Visual Studio Designer before you build the 
                         project, you may see an error which states that the Designer could not find the 
                         type 'NationalInstruments.Examples.Reader.TdmsReaderUserControl'. To fix this 
                         error, build the project and then reopen the main form.
