Description:             This example program demonstrates how to use the BasicFunctionGenerator
			 class to create different types of signals. In this example, the following signal
			 types can be generated:  sine, triangle, square, and sawtooth.  For each of these 
			 signals, the amplitude, frequency, number of samples, offset, and sampling rate can 
			 be adjusted.  Once this information is set up, you can click the Generate button 
			 to show the resulting signal.
