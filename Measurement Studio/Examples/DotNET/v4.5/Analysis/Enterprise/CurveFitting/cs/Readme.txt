Description:             This example program demonstrates how to use the PolynomialFit
			 curve fitting function in the Analysis library, as well as the
			 BasicFunctionGenerator, to create a sine wave. You can specify
			 the number of samples for the sine wave and the polynomial order
 			 for the PolynomialFit method. When you click Update, the sine wave 
			 is graphed along with the PolynomialFit's fitted function. The 
			 first three coefficients of this function and its mean squared error 
			 are displayed.
			 Limitations:  The polynomial order cannot be below 2.
				       The number of samples must always be greater than
				       the polynomial order.
