Description:             This program serves as an example use of the Spectrum and PowerFrequencyEstimate functions. The top graph displays the input signal in the time domain and the bottom graph displays the power spectrum of the filtered input signal. You can use the mouse to move the graph cursor to an area that you wish to know the peak frequency and its power.
