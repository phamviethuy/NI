Description:             This example demonstrates the use of the Peak Detector. Threshold Peak and Threshold Valley controls are used to set threshold for peaks and valleys. The default value of threshold is 0.0. PD Width controls the number of consecutive data points to be used in the quardratic least squares fit for the detection of peaks.
