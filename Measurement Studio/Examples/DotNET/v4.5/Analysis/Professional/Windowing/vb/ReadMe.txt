Description:             This example program demonstrates how to use different windowing functions.  The effects 
			 of different types of window functions are best illustrated in the frequency domain.  
			 This program combines two sinusoidal waveforms, one of which has a greater amplitude 
			 by a factor of 1000. When you look at the frequency spectrum on a linear scale with no windowing 
			 applied, the higher amplitude waveform hides the lower amplitude waveform. 		
			 By applying the Hanning Window function to the combined waveform and displaying the spectrum 
			 in a dB format, the lower amplitude waveform is detectable.
