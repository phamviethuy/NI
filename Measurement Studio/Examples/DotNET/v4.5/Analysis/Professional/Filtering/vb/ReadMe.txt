Description:             This example shows the FFT of filtered signal, filtered noisy signal, unfiltered signal, and unfiltered noisy signal waveform data. Both upper and lower cutoff frequency must be less than the half of sampling rate to satisfy the Nquist Criterion. Lower cutoff must be less than the upper cutoff and Attenuation should be greater than the ripple.
