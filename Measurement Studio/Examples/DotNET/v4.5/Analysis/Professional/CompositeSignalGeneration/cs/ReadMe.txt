Description:             This example program demonstrates how to use the SignalGenerator
			 class to create composite signals. In this example, three signals
			 are being continuously generated:  two sine wave signals and one white 
			 noise signal. The On/Off switch starts and stops the generation. Once 
			 the signals are generated, you can control the amplitudes and frequencies 
			 of the sine waves as well as the amplitude of the white noise pattern.  
			 The phases of the sine waves are displayed when the graph is updated.
